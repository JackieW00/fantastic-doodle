## Our Story
We started out as a group of people that wanted to do Physics homework, but didn't like wasting time and paper having to actually write it out on looseleaf. We wanted a simple, fun, and interactive way to do work and actually enjoy it. Our first idea was to use Paint to try to work out our problems, but soon we realized this didn't work well with a trackpad or mouse. So we decided we should just find a way to use our hand to draw. While walking through the halls of Stuyvesant, we noticed some tape on the wall that really contrasted with its surroundings. Then it hit us: we could use a color difference to resemble the tip of a paintbrush. We quickly went back to our computers and the future was born: BlueBrush.
